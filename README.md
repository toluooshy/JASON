# JASON

### This was a game that I developed with Java during the summer of 2016.  
Because of it's sentimental value all production on this project was stopped in 2017 after its initial release.   
__To play just run JASON.jar__

_The other jar file, game.jar, was a smaller functionality demo that I created in 2015. I added it here to showcase the progression of my skills from before my first legitamate Computer Science classes in highschool and after._
